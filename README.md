# TyreLock

Tyrelock is the creation of hyprlock from my hands, it is made in a simple, minimalist way, without so many effects or so much absurd madness possible, considering this, it is a minimalist configuration, Below I leave you an image and I will tell you how to install it, I must warn you that I am new to this world of programming, so, if there are any recommendations, I would appreciate them on my social networks.

# CONFIGURATION INSTALLATION

The simple installation, which is just to do a git clone, and from there, the installation is on your own, although I warn you in advance, you can also access the folder here, and enter and Ctrl + C accompanied by Ctrol + V inside the hyprland, hyprlock configuration, the following route: 
bash
cd .config/hypr
'''
And there in that folder, there is the call for "hyprlock.conf", but it is also valid to create it if you can't find it with ls, in the following way:
'''bash
mkdir -p hyprlock
'''
Please note that you need to be in the folder with cd beforehand, otherwise you will have to enter your full path. The other way is with git clone:
'''bash
git clone https://github.com/HockeySy/TyreLock.git
