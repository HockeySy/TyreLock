# TyreLock

Tyrelock is the creation of hyprlock from my hands, it is made in a simple, minimalist way, without so many effects or so much absurd madness possible, considering this, it is a minimalist configuration, Below I leave you an image and I will tell you how to install it, I must warn you that I am new to this world of programming, so, if there are any recommendations, I would appreciate them on my social networks.

The configuration is simple as I said before, done in a boring afternoon, sooner or later I will apply a script so that there is an automatic application, and it does not have to be manual


# CONFIGURATION INSTALLATION

The simple installation, which is just to do a git clone, and from there, the installation is on your own, although I warn you in advance, you can also access the folder here, and enter and Ctrl + C accompanied by Ctrl + V inside the hyprland, hyprlock configuration, the following route: 
```bash
cd .config/hypr
```
And there in that folder, there is the call for "hyprlock.conf", but it is also valid to create it if you can't find it with ls, in the following way:
```bash
mkdir -p hyprlock
```
Please note that you need to be in the folder with cd beforehand, otherwise you will have to enter your full path. The other way is with git clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HockeySy/TyreLock.git
```

# Simple description 
I have added a Cross in the middle of the screen, using halign and valign, you can move the position to your liking and essence, it keeps a simple time, without much effect, using $TIME below your username with the Arch Linux logo, the password in the center with a favorable position, maintaining the essence, well that's how the description ends, in the background we used blur, with a blur 2, and although the configuration is simple, I didn't want to have a configuration full of animations, so this is it, thanks for reading, and may Jehovah be with you everywhere
